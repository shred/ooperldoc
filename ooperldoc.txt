1. OOPerlDoc
-----------------------------------------------------
  OOPerlDoc is a tool that has been designed to create a good-looking
  HTML documentation out of Perl programs. It was focussed on object
  oriented Perl programming, but it is usable for procedural Perl
  modules as well.

  The resulting HTML document consists of several HTML files which are
  linked to each other. You can see them with every HTML 3.2 compliant
  web browser that supports frames.


1.1. Invocation
-----------------------------------------------------
  OOPerlDoc is invoked from the shell, like this:

    ooperldoc [options] [dir1 [dir2 [..]]]

  Options are:

    -h          --help            Show short help summary, and exit.

    -D [dir]    --dir [dir]       Select the output directory where the
                                  HTML files are put into. The current
                                  directory will be used if this
                                  parameter is omitted.

    -s          --source          Add sourcecode to documentation. The
                                  source files will be syntax highlighted
                                  (in a simple way), put into a "src"
                                  directory within the output directory,
                                  and referenced by the class and method
                                  documentation. This will take some more
                                  time, and blow up the documentation a
                                  big deal. Some people also do not want
                                  to make their source public. Thus, this
                                  option is turned off by default.
    
    -v          --verbose         Verbose output of what OOPerlDoc is
                                  currently doing.

    -O          --overwrite       Force OOPerlDoc to overwrite its
                                  stylesheet file style.css. By default,
                                  the stylesheet file is kept when it is
                                  found, in case it was customized.
                                  
    -p          --private         The documentation will also contain
                                  all methods which were declared as
                                  "private". If omitted, private methods
                                  will be ignored.

    -t [title]  --title [title]   The document's title as it will be
                                  shown in the browser's title bar.

                --temp            Convert temporary files as well. This
                                  are all files having a period '.' as
                                  the first file name letter, or a tilde
                                  '~' as its last letter. If omitted,
                                  temporary files and directories will
                                  be ignored.

  After the options, a list of one or more directories is following.
  These directories are scanned recursively (temporary files will be
  ignored, see '--temp' option above), and every readable file is parsed
  for OOPerlDoc comments.

  If the list of directories is omitted, all files starting from the
  current directory, will be scanned.

  OOPerlDoc parses every readable file in the given directory tree(s).
  After that, it generates a documentation file for each valid class
  file it has found.


2. Rules for valid OOPerlDoc comments
-----------------------------------------------------

  OOPerlDoc is only parsing through a file for special comment blocks.
  Lines of Perl code will be ignored. Thus, OOPerlDoc is also suited for
  uncomplete programs, as well as for other programming languages which
  are using Perl style comments (as e.g. shell scripts). It is not
  limited to compileable Perl code.

  The source code is divided into one or more comment blocks, which are
  again divided into one or more sections.


2.1. Comment blocks
-----------------------------------------------------

  A comment block always starts with a double hash '##'. After that,
  only zero or more whitespaces, dashes '-' and equal signs '=' are
  allowed.

  The block extends over all subsequent lines which are starting with a
  single hash '#'. A block ends if no hash '#' is found in a line, or if
  there were leadinging non-whitespace characters.

  There must be at least one non-commented line (e.g. an empty line)
  between two comment blocks for now. This may change in a future
  release.

  You may indent the comment blocks with spaces and tabs.

  To improve the look of a comment, you can always add comment lines
  which entirely consist of whitespace, dashes '-' and equal signs '='
  after the hash '#'. Those lines will be ignored by OOPerlDoc.

  Examples will follow below.


2.2. Sections
-----------------------------------------------------

  A comment block is divided into one or more sections.

  A section is started by a certain section name. All subsequent lines
  then refer to this section, until the comment block ends, or a new
  section is opened.

  A section name is always written in capital letters only. After that,
  a colon may follow. The rest of the line must only contain
  whitespaces.

  Sections may be interrupted by other sections, and resumed later
  within the same comment block, by using the section name again. Anyhow
  we strongly discourage you to use this.


2.3. Content of a section
-----------------------------------------------------

  After a section name, the content of the section is following.

  The formatting of the content depends on the section name.

  In some sections, it is allowed (and you are encouraged) to use HTML
  markup. Anyhow you should limit yourself to very simple HTML 3.2,
  without browser dependent code.

  <img> tags are only allowed if the image source is an absolute URL
  referring to a server. It should be rarely used though.

  OOPerlDoc will remove all whitespaces following a hash '#'. This can
  lead to problems in preformatted environments, as <pre> containers.
  So, to avoid whitespace stripping, you can put a dash '|' at the
  position where whitespaces should be taken to the final documentation.
  All whitespace before the dash, and the dash itself, will be stripped.

  Example:

  # EXAMPLE:
  #     <pre>
  #       if(a == b) {
  #         print "A gleich B\n";
  #         a = 0;
  #       }
  #     </pre>

  will result in

  if(a == b) {
  print "A gleich B\n";
  a = 0;
  }

  in the documentation, because all whitespace were stripped. Now use
  dashes like this:

  # EXAMPLE:
  #     <pre>
  #     |  if(a == b) {
  #     |    print "A gleich B\n";
  #     |    a = 0;
  #     |  }
  #     </pre>

  to get the result you have expected:c

    if(a == b) {
      print "A gleich B\n";
      a = 0;
    }

  IMPORTANT: since HTML markup is used, remember to replace all smaller
  signs '<' and ampersand '&' in your program code by the appropriate
  HTML entities.

  OOPerlDoc cares about some formatting for you.

  First, the keyword "undef" will automatically placed within a <code>
  container and is rendered in a fixed width font in the documentation.

  Hyperlinks starting with "http", "https" and "ftp", are converted into
  real links.

  Finally, if you use a class name that is known to OOPerlDoc (because
  that class will be converted within the same OOPerlDoc invocation), it
  will automatically place a link onto this class.


3. Comment types
-----------------------------------------------------

  The Perl source contains several comment types.


3.1. Class comments
-----------------------------------------------------

  This comment type describes the entire class file itself. It must be
  present in order to let OOPerlDoc convert this class. It is strongly
  suggested to place this comment at the topmost position of the file.

  These sections can be used in a class comment (a detailed description
  will follow below):

    CLASS           The name of the class. Required!

    NAME            Used instead of CLASS, but for procedural modules.

    EXTENDS         List of super classes this class is derived from.
                    Note that even though you can list more than one
                    superclass here, OOPerlDoc does not support multiple
                    inheritance yet.

    PURPOSE         The purpose of this class. Required!
    
    NOTE            Important note about this class. This note will be
                    shown separately, with a "Note:" written before,
                    so it will easily be seen.

    REQUIRES        Other modules, classes and programs this class
                    depends on.

    DEPRECATED      If the class has been deprecated, use this section.
                    State the reason of deprecation and show a possible
                    replacement here.

    AUTHOR          Author(s) of this class.

    VERSION         Version and date.

    CVS             Reserved for CVS version ID.

    HISTORY         Change history of this class.

    SEE             Cross references to other classes and further
                    information about the topic.

    COPYRIGHT       Copyright note.

    SINCE           Version of the software where this class has been
                    introduced. This is important for backward
                    compatibility.

  This is an example of a valid class comment:

    ##------------------------------------------------------
    # CLASS:
    #   static: Examples::CL_Example
    # EXTENDS:
    #   Examples::CL_Super
    #

    #-------------------------------------------------------
    # HISTORY:
    #	  V1.0 (2000-08-22) rkoerber
    #     - First release of this class
    #-------------------------------------------------------



3.1.1. CLASS
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    CLASS

  CONTEXT:    class comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    This section introduces a class comment, by describing the class
    name. If the Perl module is not a class, but a procedural module,
    you should use NAME instead of class (see 3.1.2).

  CONTENT:
    The section only contains the class name, which is optionally
    preceeded by modifiers. The list of modifiers is separated by
    space and terminated by a colon.

      [modifier [' ' modifier ...] ': '] class_name

    If no modifieres are given, you may leave out the colon.

    You are not allowed to add further text.

    These modifiers are allowed:

      static        Static class, cannot be instantiated.

      abstract      This class contains at least one abstract method.
                    Only its derivates can be instantiated.

      final         This class is finished and must not be derivated.

      deprecated    This class is entirely obsoleted. It may be removed
                    in future releases, and must not be used in new
                    code.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # CLASS
    #     Package::FooClass
    :

    :
    # CLASS
    #     static final: Package::FinalClass
    :



3.1.2. NAME
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    NAME

  CONTEXT:    class comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    If this module describes a procedural program rather than an OOP
    class, you should use "NAME" instead of "CLASS" (see 3.1.1.).

  CONTENT:
    See 3.1.1. "CLASS".

    Only the "deprecated" modifier may be used here. Other modifiers are
    for OOP purposes only, and not of relevance in procedural
    programming.

    If you use "NAME" instead of "CLASS", you should also use "FUNCTION"
    instead of "METHOD".

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # NAME
    #     Package::FooModule
    :

    :
    # NAME
    #     deprecated: Package::DeprecatedModule
    :



3.1.3. EXTENDS
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    EXTENDS

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    Used in a class comment, to list all super classes this class is
    derived from. If this section is omitted, the class will implicitly
    be derived from UNIVERSAL.

  CONTENT:
    A list of the names of all super classes. The names are separated by
    comma or line breaks. Other text and HTML markup is not allowed.

    OOPerlDoc does not support multiple inheritance yet. Thus, if you
    give a list of names, only the first name will be used for
    generating a class tree. The following names are just listed in the
    class description.

  NOTE:
    This section is required because OOPerlDoc will not evaluate the
    @ISA list.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # EXTENDS:
    #     MyClass::MySuperClass
    :

    :
    # EXTENDS:
    #     MyClass::MySuperClass, MyClass::SecondClass
    #     HelpPackage::UniversalHelp
    :



3.1.4. PURPOSE
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    PURPOSE

  CONTEXT:    class comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    Describe the purpose of the class or module.

  CONTENT:
    A plain text of your choice. The first sentence should always
    describe a short summary of the purpose of this class. The next
    sentences will then describe more details.

    You are allowed (and encouraged) to use HTML markup here.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # PURPOSE:
    #     A demonstration class. This text demonstrates how
    #     to use the <code>PURPOSE</code> section in a class
    #     comment.
    :



3.1.5. NOTE
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    NOTE

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    Important note about this class. Optional. The purpose is to
    the user very important information about how to use this class
    and avoid bugs.

  CONTENT:
    This is plain text. HTML markup is allowed. Known class names will
    be linked to the appropriate documentation automatically.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # NOTE:
    #   This class is often mixed up with ExampleClass2.
    :



3.1.6. REQUIRES
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    REQUIRES

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    A list of things this class requires to run properly. This can be
    other classes, installed Perl packages, third party software etc.

  CONTENT:
    There is no special format defined for this section. You may use
    HTML markup. Known class names will be linked automatically.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # REQUIRES:
    #     <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>
    :


3.1.7. DEPRECATED
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    DEPRECATED

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    Contains further details about the deprecation.

  CONTENT:
    If you have marked a class as deprecated (by the deprecated
    modifier, see 3.1.1. and 3.1.2.), you are encouraged to write in
    this section:

      * Why has the class been deprecated?
      * How can the functionality be replaced? (i.e. is there a new
        class that replaces this class?)

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # DEPRECATED:
    #     This class has been replaced by ReplacerClass. Do not
    #     use this class in new code.
    :



3.1.8. VERSION
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    VERSION

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    Describes the current version and release date of this class.

  CONTENT:
    The syntax is:

      ('V'|'v') nr ['.' nr [...]] ['(' year '-' month '-' day ')']

    This section starts with either a capital or small 'V', followed by
    a version number (with subversions divided by a period). Optionally,
    a date may follow within brackets. The format is YYYY-MM-DD.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # VERSION:
    #     V3.0.2 (2000-08-24)
    :


3.1.9. CVS

  SECTION:    CVS

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    This section contains the version number that is maintained by CVS.

  CONTENT:
    The initial content is just 'Id' enclosed in dollar signs. It will
    be updated by CVS automatically, everytime the content is committed
    to the repository.

  NOTE:
    It is a capital 'I' and a small 'd', surrounded by dollar signs.



3.1.10. HISTORY
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    HISTORY

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  CONTEXT:    class comment

  PURPOSE:
    Version of this software, when this class has been introduced.

  CONTENT:
    Describes the version of the entire software package where this
    class has been introduced. A programmer will know that this version
    of the software package is required if he uses this class.

    The format is equal to VERSION (3.1.7.), see there.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # SINCE:
    #     V2.1.3 (2000-04-12)
    :



3.2. Attributes comment
-----------------------------------------------------

  This comment type lists all class attributes which are available.

  Perl does not know about class attributes like other OOP related
  programming languages. Instead, there usually is a hash variable that
  is blessed to the package name.

  The attribute comment block contains a table of all hash keys of that
  hash, and their meaning.

  In the documentation, the attribute comment will be shown below the
  class outline.

  This is an example of a valid attribute comment:

    ##------------------------------------------------------
    # ATTRIBUTES:
    #   public: type              => object type
    #   private: name             => some name
    #   public readonly: shape    => some shape instance
    #-------------------------------------------------------


3.2.1. ATTRIBUTES
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    ATTRIBUTES

  CONTEXT:    attribute comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    List of all class attributes.

  CONTENT:
    The content consists of key-value-pairs.

    The key is a valid identifier name (only letters, numbers and
    underscore is allowed), which may be prefixed by modifiers. The
    modifiers are separated by a colon.

    After the key, the hash operator '=>' must follow. After that, the
    description follows. The description may extend to the next lines.
    It is stopped as soon as a new valid key is recognized.

    Syntax:

      [modifier [modifier ...] ':'] name '=>' description

    These modifiers are allowed:

      public      Attribute is public (i.e. accessible by all classes)
      protected   Attribute is protected (i.e. accessible only by the
                  class itself, and its subclasses)
      private     Attribute is private (i.e. accessible only to the
                  class itself)

      readonly    The attribute is read only. Only the owner instance
                  itself is allowed to change it.

      restricted  The attribute access is restricted. The owner class,
                  and its subclasses, are allowed to change it. All
                  other classes only have read access.

      final       A constant value. The attribute is set at construction
                  time, and then will not change any more. Even the
                  owner class is not allowed to change the value.

      deprecated  This attribute is deprecated. It may be removed in
                  future releases. Do not use in new code.

    The description may use HTML markup. Known class names will be
    linked automatically.



3.3. General comment
-----------------------------------------------------

  A general comment can be used for all kind of purposes.

  The comment block output is arranged below the attribute comment
  output. You can have several general comments, which are put below
  each other in the sequence they are found.

  A general comment always consists of a title, which will be put to the
  top of the table.

  Additionally, you can put plain text, a key-value table, or both.

  The plain text content is put into a COMMENT section. The key-value
  table is put into a HASHMAP section.

  If you use both, the plain text is always shown above the key-value
  table. This may change in a future release of OOPerlDoc, so you
  shouldn't rely on that. You are encouraged to always use the COMMENT
  section first, and the HASHMAP section after that. Never use more than
  one of these sections in each general comment, for now.

  Example:

    ##------------------------------------------------------
    # EXTRA
    #   Keys
    #
    # COMMENT
    #   List of all keys that can be passed to the
    #   <code>get_key</code> method.
    #
    # HASHMAP
    #   name        => First and family name
    #   street      => Street and number
    #   town        => ZIP and town
    #-------------------------------------------------------





3.3.1. EXTRA
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    EXTRA

  CONTEXT:    general comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    Title of a general comment.

  CONTENT:
    This section starts a new general comment. The content is used as
    the title of the comment table.

    The title must be present, but quite short (only a few words), and
    must not use HTML markup.


3.3.2. COMMENT
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    COMMENT

  CONTEXT:    general comment

  PURPOSE:
    Contains a general, plain comment.

  CONTENT:
    This comment is just plain text which may be decorated by HTML
    markup. Links to known classes will be created automatically.



3.3.3. HASHMAP
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    HASHMAP

  CONTEXT:    general comment

  PURPOSE:
    A map of key-value-pairs. A table with two columns will be generated
    for that.

  CONTENT:
    The content consists of key-value-pairs.

    The key is a free text, but it must not contain HTML markup.

    In the same line of the key, the hash operator '=>' must follow.

    After that, the description follows. The description may extend to
    the next lines. It is stopped as soon as a new line with the hash
    operator '=>', or the end of the comment block, was found.

    The description may contain HTML markup. Known class names will be
    linked automatically.



3.4. Method comments
-----------------------------------------------------

  This comment block is to be put before each method. It describes the
  purpose, and the input and return values, of this method.

  Since OOPerlDoc ignores the program code itself, it is not required
  that the method comment is placed before the 'sub' definition of the
  method (anyhow we encourage you to do so). Besides that, you can also
  create method comments without methods, e.g. to define abstract
  methods.

  These sections can be used within a method comment (a detailed
  description will follow below):

    METHOD          The name of the method. Required!

    FUNCTION        If the Perl package is not object oriented, but a
                    procedural module, you should use FUNCTION instead
                    of METHOD. Required!

    DESCRIPTION     Description about the functionality of the method.
                    Required!

    NOTE            Important note about this method. This note will be
                    shown separately, with a "Note:" written before,
                    so it will easily be seen. (Optional)

    INPUT           A list of all mandatory input parameters.

    OPTIONAL        A list of all optional input parameters.

    RETURN          A list of all return values.

    THROWS          A list of all exceptions this method generates.

    AUTHOR          Author(s) of this method, if different from the
                    AUTHOR section of the class comment.

    VERSION         Version of this method.

    DEPRECATED      If the method is deprecated, you can explain the
                    reasons here, and how the programmer can replace the
                    functionality.

    SEE             Cross references to other methods, classes and
                    further information about the topic.

    SINCE           Version of the software where this method has been
                    introduced. This is important for backward
                    compatibility.

  This is an example of the valid method comment.

    ##------------------------------------------------------
    # METHOD:
    #   public: get_names
    #
    # DESCRIPTION:
    #   Get a list of all names. If no name does exist,
    #   undef will be returned.
    #
    # NOTE:
    #   Due to a bug, previous versions returned 0 instead
    #   of undef.
    #
    # INPUT:
    #   $id        -- Name list ID to be fetched
    #
    # RETURN:
    #   List of all names, or undef
    #-------------------------------------------------------



3.4.1. METHOD
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    METHOD

  CONTEXT:    method comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    This section introduces a method comment, by describing the method
    name. If the Perl module is not a class, but a procedural module,
    you should use FUNCTION instead of METHOD (see 3.4.2).

  CONTENT:
    The section only contains the method name, which is optionally
    preceeded by modifiers. The list of modifiers is separated by
    space and terminated by a colon.

      [modifier [' ' modifier ...] ': '] method_name

    If no modifiers are given, you may leave out the colon. The method
    is then regarded as public.

    You are not allowed to add further text.

    These modifiers are allowed:

      public        Public method. All classes can invoke it.

      protected     Protected method. Only the superclass and all
                    derivated classes are allowed to invoke it.

      private       Private method. Only the class it self is allowed to
                    invoke it. Private methods are not documented by
                    OOPerlDoc unless required. By convention, private
                    method names always start with an underscore.

      constructor   A constructor of this class. Usually named as 'new'.

      destructor    The destructor of this class. Perl only allows one
                    destructor, which must have the name 'DESTROY'.

      static        Class method. No instance is needed to invoke this
                    method.

      hybrid        Class and instance method. This method does not care
                    if invoked as class method, or instance method. This
                    is a Perl speciality. Implies 'static'.

      abstract      This method is not implemented in this class, but
                    must be implemented at one of its derivates. If at
                    least one method is declared as abstract, you must
                    declare the whole class as abstract (see CLASS,
                    3.1.1.).

      final         This method must not be replaced in a subclass.

      deprecated    The method is deprecated, and may be removed in
                    future releases of this class. Do not use it in new
                    programs.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # METHOD
    #     get_name
    :

    :
    # METHOD
    #     public static: get_name_by_id
    :

    :
    # METHOD
    #     private: _convert_id
    :


3.4.2. FUNCTION
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    FUNCTION

  CONTEXT:    method comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    Contains the name of the function. If the module is written in a
    procedural fashion instead of OOP, use FUNCTION instead of METHOD.

  CONTENT:
    Only the name of the function is allowed here. No modifiers, or
    other additions. In an OOP context, FUNCTIONs are always regarded as
    "public static final" (see 3.4.1.).

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # FUNCTION
    #   set_command_id
    :



3.4.3. DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    DESCRIPTION

  CONTEXT:    method comment (REQUIRED SECTION)

  PURPOSE:
    Describes the purpose of this method or function.

    The first sentence will also be used in the method summary at the
    top of the documentation. This sentence should be quite short and
    self-explaining.

  CONTENT:
    This is plain text. HTML markup is allowed. Known class names will
    be linked to the appropriate documentation automatically.

  NOTE:
    OOPerlDoc regards the end of the first sentence at the first period
    it finds, or at the end of the only sentence. Thus, try to avoid
    periods in the first sentence which could be mixed up.

    Example: For the description "Calculates pi as 3.141592", OOPerlDoc
    would extract "Calculates as to 3." as the first sentence.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # DESCRIPTION
    #   Get a list of all members. The member list is sorted
    #   alphabetically by the member name. If the list is empty,
    #   undef is returned instead.
    :


3.4.4. NOTE
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    NOTE

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    Important note about this method or function. Optional. The
    purpose is to give the user very important information about
    how to use this method and to avoid bugs.

  CONTENT:
    This is plain text. HTML markup is allowed. Known class names will
    be linked to the appropriate documentation automatically.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # NOTE
    #   This method may also return undef, which may be a little
    #   unexpected in some situations. Always check for it!
    :


3.4.5. INPUT
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    INPUT

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    List of all required input parameters passed to this method.
    Optional input parameters are listed in the OPTIONAL section (see
    3.4.5.). If there are no required parameters for this method, you
    can skip this section.
    
  CONTENT:
    This section optionally starts with a plain text. This text may use
    HTML markup. Known class names will be linked to the appropriate
    documentation automatically.

    After the optional plain text, several variable descriptions or
    key-value-pairs may follow.
    
    A variable description starts with the variable name in a new line,
    followed by a space (!) and two minus signs ' --', followed by the
    description of that variable. The description may contain HTML
    markup and may extend by several lines. It is stopped as soon as a
    new variable name and the two minus signs are recognized in a line.
    
    The variable name must follow certain syntax rules, to be recognized
    properly. It may start with a backslash '\' (which means reference),
    followed by a symbol that describes the variable type (one of '$',
    '@', '%', '&' and '*'), followed by the variable name itself.
    
    If you pass a hash list to the method, you can also use
    key-value pairs. Here, you start with the key name, followed by the
    hash operator '=>', followed by the description. The description may
    contain HTML markup.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  
    :
    # INPUT:
    #   \@hash_hr         -- Hash reference that contains further
    #                        details for the process.
    #   $name             -- Some name
    :
  
    :
    # INPUT:
    #   Some values in loose order
    :
  
    :
    # INPUT:
    #   This method expects these parameters:
    #     \@hash_hr       -- Hash reference that contains further
    #                        details for the process.
    #     $name           -- Some name
    :
  
    :
    # INPUT:
    #   This method expects a hash with these parameters, in
    #   loose order:
    #     hash_hr         => Hash reference that contains further
    #                        details for the process.
    #     name            => Some name
    :
  
 
3.4.6. OPTIONAL
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    OPTIONAL

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    List of all optional input parameters passed to this method.
    Mandatory input parameters are listed in the INPUT section (see
    3.4.4.). If there are no optional parameters for this method, you
    can skip this section.
    
  CONTENT:
    See INPUT (3.4.4.).
    
  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # OPTIONAL:
    #   You may also pass these parameters, in loose order:
    #     hash_hr         => Hash reference that contains further
    #                        details for the process.
    #     name            => Some name
    :

    
    
3.4.7. RETURN
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    RETURN

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    List of all values returned from this method. Usually, this will
    only be one value, but since Perl can also return lists and hashes,
    you can also list more than one value here.
    
  CONTENT:
    See INPUT (3.4.4.).
    
  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # RETURN:
    #   List of all names, or undef.
    :

    :
    # RETURN:
    #   Returns a hash, with these keys:
    #     name          => User name
    #     street        => User address
    #     phone         => User phone number
    :


3.4.8. THROWS
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    THROWS

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    Documents all exceptions this method can throw.
  
  CONTENT:
    First, the verbatim exception text is written (in quotation marks,
    optionally), followed by a space (!) and two minus signs ' --',
    followed by a detailed description of this exception.
    
    You must not use HTML markup in the exception text. But you may
    prefix replacers with a dollar sign (e.g. "user $username is 
    unknown").
  
    The description may use HTML markup and may also extend over several
    lines. The description is finished when a new exception text is
    recognized (by the ' --') or when the section is finished.

  NOTE:
    The THROWS section only contains exceptions this method will throw.
    This list is incomplete, because the method may call other methods
    which in turn may throw other exceptions.
  
  EXAMPLE:
  
    :
    # THROWS:
    #     "Unknown user $name"    -- User is not known, thus
    #             you are not allowed to access the system.
    #     "User access expired"   -- User does exist, but his
    #             account has expired.
    :
  
  
3.4.9. AUTHOR
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    AUTHOR

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  SEE:        class comment's AUTHOR section: 3.1.????


3.4.10. VERSION
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    VERSION

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  SEE:        class comment's VERSION section: 3.1.????

  
  
3.4.11. DEPRECATED
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    DEPRECATED

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    Contains further details about the deprecation.

  CONTENT:
    If you have marked a method as deprecated (by the deprecated
    modifier, see 3.4.1.), you are encouraged to write in this section:

      * Since which version has this method been deprecated?
      * Why has the method been deprecated?
      * How can the functionality be replaced? (i.e. is there a new
        method that replaces this method?)

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # DEPRECATED:
    #     This method has been deprecated because of several
    #     cleanups we have done to this class. You can now use
    #     <code>get_info</code> instead, and pass INFO_NAME
    #     there to get the information you got before.
    #     <p>
    #     This method will be removed in a future version of
    #     the class. Do not use it in new code.
    :

    
3.4.12. SEE
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    SEE

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    Cross reference to other methods and further information about the
    topic.

  CONTENT:
    A link to everything that is related to this method, as other
    methods, classes, literature, etc.

    You may use HTML markup here. Known class names will be linked.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # SEE:
    #     get_as_png,
    #     <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">PNG specs</a>
    :

    
    

3.4.13. SINCE
-----------------------------------------------------

  SECTION:    SINCE

  CONTEXT:    method comment

  PURPOSE:
    Version of this class or software, when this method has been
    introduced.

  CONTENT:
    Describes the version of the class or entire software package where
    this class has been introduced. A programmer will know that this
    version is required to invoke this method.

    The format is equal to VERSION (3.1.7.), see there.

  EXAMPLE:

    :
    # SINCE:
    #     V2.1.3 (2000-04-12)
    :


    
3.5. CIPP object comments
-----------------------------------------------------

  This new comment type has been introduced with OOPerlDoc V1.20.

  It is used to comment CIPP objects. CIPP is a web development add-on
  for Perl, comparable to JSP or PHP.
  
  A CIPP object block is a combination of a Class comment and a Method
  comment. While it is used like a Class comment, it also allows a list
  of INPUT, OPTIONAL and RETURN parameters. OOPerlDoc will generate a
  virtual Method comment for those parameters, with the Method name
  taken from the Class name.
  
  Note that you must use this block instead of and like a Class comment
  block (see 3.1). This means that you must not use this block more than
  once per file, and if you are using it, you must not use a Class
  comment block.

  These sections can be used within a CIPP object comment:

    CIPPOBJECT      The name of the CIPP object. Required!

    PURPOSE         A description of the CIPP object. This will also be
                    used as the description of the virtual method block.
    
    NOTE            Important note about this object. This note will be
                    shown separately, with a "Note:" written before,
                    so it will easily be seen. (Optional)

    INPUT           A list of all mandatory input parameters.

    OPTIONAL        A list of all optional input parameters.

    RETURN          A list of all return values.

    THROWS          A list of all exceptions this method generates.

    REQUIRES        Other modules, classes and programs this class
                    depends on.

    DEPRECATED      If the class has been deprecated, use this section.
                    State the reason of deprecation and show a possible
                    replacement here.

    AUTHOR          Author(s) of this class.

    VERSION         Version and date.

    CVS             Reserved for CVS version ID.

    HISTORY         Change history of this class.

    SEE             Cross references to other classes and further
                    information about the topic.

    COPYRIGHT       Copyright note.

    SINCE           Version of the software where this class has been
                    introduced. This is important for backward
                    compatibility.

  This is an example of the valid CIPP object comment.

B. OOPerlDoc History
-----------------------------------------------------

   V1.22 (2002-09-13) rkoerber
     - BUGFIX: OOPerlDoc was caught in an endless loop when
       a class only consisted of private methods
     - BUGFIX: Private attributes were not sorted properly to the
       end of the list
       
   V1.21 (2002-07-09) rkoerber
     - Optionally, the class' source code can be added to the
       documentation. It is fully linked, but does not have
       a decent syntax highlighting yet.
     - Circular inheritance will now be detected and leads to
       an error instead of an endless loop. [Bug 1435]
       
   V1.20 (2002-05-16) rkoerber
     - Added new block type CIPPOBJECT
     - Made OOPerlDoc a little more error tolerant (e.g.
       accepts RETURN, RETURNS and OUTPUT now).

   V1.19 (2002-04-25) rkoerber
     - ':' is now optional for delimiting method names. If it
       is ommitted, the last word is taken (which is usually
       the method name). Anyhow you are encouraged to write a
       colon!
     - BUGFIX: when a class just had one private method or
       one private class method, ooperldoc would hang in an
       infinite loop. Fixed.
     - BUGFIX: Class list of certain packets was always empty.

   V1.18 (2002-03-21) rkoerber
     - Class list by name now shows appropriate package path
     - Besides '::' now '.' are allowed as package delimiter

   V1.17 (2002-01-31) rkoerber
     - Now you can select in a third frame, what package classes
       you want to see.
     - You can have a view of the class names only.

   V1.16 (2002-01-31) rkoerber
     - BUGFIX: References to classes in Foo::Bar notation was broken
       since the very beginning. And no one noticed that...
     - Now also references to class methods like Foo::Bar->meth() is
       linked to the appropriate place.
     - If a class name itself is not known, it is searched in the
       current packet as well.

   V1.15 (2002-01-31) rkoerber
     - Deprecated attribute of methods are now also listed in the
       method summary.
     - Private method and attribute names (starting with an underscore)
       are now at the bottom of the method and attribute summary
     - Attribute summary is now sorted and a little prettier (attribute
       name comes first, followed by modifiers in brackets)
     - Method summary sentence now ends with HTML tags or double
       newlines

   V1.14 (2002-01-25) rkoerber
     - BUGFIX: THROWS was broken, now fixed again

   V1.13 (2002-01-18) rkoerber
     - Charset iso-8859-1 set in header

   V1.12 (2001-11-09) rkoerber
